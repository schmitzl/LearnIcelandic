# Learn Icelandic
A web application to practise and learn Icelandic grammar. 

After I compelted a summer course in Icelandic I wanted to be able to easily refresh and improve the learned grammar. 
Therefore I started this leisure time project. 

It is currently still under construction. As soon as all analog exercises are part of this projects, the exercises will be structured after topics 
(more suptopics than just conjugation and declension).
